# A humble solution to Bonus2

This is a solution to Bonus2 homework of FP lecture. The solution is far away from perfect. Even tough it runs without an error and satisfies all of the requirements given in the assignment, it has many issues. You can see this repository as a baseline solution to the problem. We encourage you to **SEND PULL REQUEST** to improve the quality of code. Also, we suggest you to follow (click Watch) this repository as there will be improvements. Here are some problems you might want to fix:
- *removeCard* function can be simplified
- *GameState* type is not defined.
- *runGame* function can be simplified with new *GameState* type.
- *readCards* and *readMoves* functions can be improved.

You are not bounded only to these problems, you can change anywhere else in the code if you see an improvement. You can even rewrite the functions with higher order functions to get rid of annoying recursions. If you are not familiar with *'Sending Pull Request'*, you can look at this [link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
